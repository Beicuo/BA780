Analysis of Conditions contributing to COVID-19 Deaths from years 2020-2023
This dataset shows us the total number of people that have died from various reasons from 2020 to 2023 in the United States and its regions. This was the time when COVID-19 started and we are using this dataset to evaluate and analyze the impact of COVID-19 alongside other health conditions in the United States.

Motivation and Report Summary:
We aim to assess the regions and demographic age groups most susceptible to COVID-19-related mortality, allowing us to strategically allocate our vaccination resources to target these high-risk areas. This is done due to the countless people who suffered from this disease and we aim to help organizations better understand this data to make better public health decisions.
